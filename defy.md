# defy

### options
- ability to purchase a set of each letter/symbol in R2, R3, and R4 shapes (5x4 + 5x4 + 7 (47x3 keys?)).
	- for someone that likes to move keys around or try a different layout, this is invaluable
	- I though I can type with qwerty, I want to use the defy with the workman layout (which means I have many keys that are the wrong row), there are some key positions that I think can be improved as well, so I want to be able to try new things
	- also with the layout-analyser (LE) function, it can only suggest optimisations to my layout where the key stays in the same row (unless I have the dot keycaps)

### possible improvements
- inside the wrist pads, the magnets are set in such a way that if I put the two wristpads together, the pads don't line up. since there is already a left/right pad, offsetting one of the magnets could line them up
